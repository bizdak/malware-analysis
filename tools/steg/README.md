Steganography Code
------------------

Hides data file in an image file. The data is split into bits: 3, 3, 2 and are stored stored as the least significant bits of rgb data. We could split it into 4 2-bit data and store the 4th one in the alpha channel, but 3 bits will not change the color significantly of each pixel, at most level difference will be up to 7.

Output is always stored as png so that the image is lossless.
The image dimensions must be bigger than the input file plus 4 bytes (for the data length). The data length is encoded in the first 4 pixels of the image.

Example files are:

- steg.jpg              : we use to hide the data to
- steg.py               : the actual code, as well as the payload we will save into steg-hidden.jpg
- steg-hidden-data.jpg  : contains steg.py


## Encoding steg.py in steg.jpg
```
>python steg.py -e steg.py -i steg.jpg -o steg-hidden-data.png
Opening image file: steg.jpg
Reading input data file: steg.py
Image size: 921600
Data size: 5070
steg.py is hidden in steg-hidden-data.png
```

## Decoding steg-hidden-data.png
```
>python steg.py -i steg-hidden-data.png -o decoded.txt
Opening image file: steg-hidden-data.png
Decoding data from image file
Expected data length: 5070
steg-hidden-data.png is decoded to decoded.txt
```
